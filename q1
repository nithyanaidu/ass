        The expression arr[1] + (arr[1] = 2) does the following:
        1. Assigns the value 2 to arr[1]
        2. Evaluates the expression arr[1] (which now equals 2)
        3. Adds the value of arr[1] (which is 2) to the original value of arr[1] (which was 12)
           and assigns the result to x
        
        Therefore, x is assigned the value 14.

}
output
14
